**How to setup the project**


Firts, you'll need to make sure you have Node and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- To check this, run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal / command line.
- If it is not installed, install - https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Node and npm are bundled together, so once Node is installed you can proceed.

Clone the repo, enter it's root directory.

First, you'll need to install all dependencies by running:

`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

The `--legacy-peer-deps` is neccessary since there is a little mismatch between version of compatible packages, but it is working regardless of that.

Than, you can run the app in your web browser, it should open automatically:

`npm run web`

---

Here you go!

That's it for now, further will be added in the future.
